# TypeJS

TypeJS is a runtime type system in Javascript designed to be a light weight replacement for TypeScript.

## Inspiration

As any software scales, there are certain components that are a necessity. A programming language needs an intuitive 
design that can support multiple design paradigms. Presently, the dominating enterprise paradigm is Object Oriented 
Programming. As a result, TypeScript was invented to scale JavaScript. The inspiration behind TypeJS could almost be 
considered a contingent against TypeScript, where a type system is implemented through functional proofs at runtime.

This project is inspired from syntax and paradigms produced thereof from C and Rust. In TypeJS, the programmer will find
the use of the `typedef` function to be the library's cornerstone.
